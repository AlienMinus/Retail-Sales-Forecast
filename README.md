# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard

An advanced, interactive web application for **Retail Sales Forecasting**, built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. This project combines data visualization, machine learning, and model interpretability to provide actionable insights for retail business decision-making.

## 📊 Overview

This dashboard is designed to empower retail businesses by:
- Visualizing historical sales trends.
- Monitoring real-time KPIs.
- Forecasting future sales using an ML model (XGBoost).
- Explaining model predictions using SHAP.
- Allowing model retraining with new data.

It’s a **multi-page Streamlit app** with powerful backend integration for data preprocessing, visualization, forecasting, and continuous learning.
